\chapter{Testing and Evaluation\label{cha:chapter5}}
In the thesis 

\section{Experimental Setup\label{sec:exp}}
... should include the following:
\begin{itemize}

\item define experimental data and workload(s),
\item discussion about the selection and interpretation of the evaluation metrics,
\item discussion about the computing environment, including hardware, software, and tools.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Design}

Tuple-based perform exceptionally well and are well-suited in data streaming. Essentially  no latency and no considerable overhead in throughput. 

Aggregation is another topic altogether. 


\section{Parameter Optimization\label{sec:parameterOptimization}}


\subsection{Interpretation of the Results}
This sub-section should include
\begin{itemize}
\item description and an interpretation of the experimental results.
\item explanation for any anomalies or any unexpected behavior.
\end{itemize}
