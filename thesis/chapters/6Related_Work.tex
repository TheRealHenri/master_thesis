A notable piece of related work is Privitar \cite{privitar}, a tool designed for anonymizing data entering distributed event stores. While Privitar is a significant step in integrating data privacy measures into distributed systems, it is important to note that its applicability is limited to a specific platform, and the full documentation of the tool is not publicly available. Furthermore, Privitar primarily focuses on protecting data during processing by encrypting the data entering the system and implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms. Additionally, it is worth noting that Privitar also claims to de-identify the data, although the specific methods or techniques employed for deidentification are not explicitly specified.
